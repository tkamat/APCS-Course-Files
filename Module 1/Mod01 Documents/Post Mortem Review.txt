+s Using the BlueJ editor was easy.
      The syntax of print statements is straightforward, but I kept forgetting to use println( )
      to force a line feed after using print( ).
      
-s Lining everything up took a lot of time.
      Made frequent typos.
           

In the future It probably would save time to write out on paper how to arrange all of the output
instead of guestimating.  Need to pay closer attention when typing to reduce silly typos.
